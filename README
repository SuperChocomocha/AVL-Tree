AVL Tree

TODO: - avlDelete doesn’t fully work, doesn’t appear to rebalance correctly
            if at all, given example for delete works
      - avlInsert not fully tested, may have bugs

USAGE: - main only runs a few hard coded tests

             can add more test cases, use current test cases as examples
             or run directly in ghci
